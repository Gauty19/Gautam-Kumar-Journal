Journal-6:Topic:About the Lecture on Artificial Neural Networks by Dr.Bhanu Priya.
In this class,a guest name Dr.Bhanu Priya shared her knowledge with us about how the artificial neural networks were built and functions.It is very similar like human beings nervous system.She took and examples of ears functioning that as we hear sound then its vibrations hits the sensory eardrums where sounds are detected and the sensory nerves of ears vibrate in that frequency and that frequency is sent to the brain and then it catches and read the frequency as codings read by the machines.And then our brain interprets the frequency and gives meaning to it.In biology it is termed as nervous system for this neuron functioning in the machine and in physics it is termed as logical operations.The logical operations it uses are OR, AND, and XOR.Through operating these the data is given output after making results out of these operations.She delivered sum equations whose elements were like activation functions, output in form of summation of all inputs and so on.Inputs are always binary and each input has equally contribution.In this neural networks weights of the machine is never neglected.Therefore, it is summed along with operations on binary sets.There are many activation functions due to the variation in inputs.
She also shared about training the networks that there are two types of training sets:1)train set and 2)Test set.These are for froward pass, to calculate activation at each layer,to estimate the loss and have proper measurements.And for comparison, three sets are there:1)train set, 2)test set and 3)cross validation.
There are terms like overfitting and underfitting.These two fittings are improper to for estimation of the inputs but it needs to be appropriate fittings so that each input can be estimated correctly without losing.And at the end of the class we had a online activity on a website called playground neural network(lin:https://playground.tensorflow.org).Through this activity we had learnt about the estimation of the losses of the data in different combinations of neaurals.It was and much more effective to me.
